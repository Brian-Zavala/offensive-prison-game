# Prison Game

**‚ö†Ô∏è CONTENT WARNING: This project contains explicit language, dark humor, and intentionally offensive descriptions. It is not suitable for children, sensitive audiences, or use in professional/educational environments.**

This is a dark-humor, text-based exploration game built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). You take on the role of a wretched inmate navigating a grotesque prison system, filled with colorful descriptions and unrelenting pessimism. The game is fully interactive and meant as an experiment in absurdist storytelling and unfiltered narrative tone.
